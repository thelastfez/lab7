Consider running Bubble and Selection Sorts on the two arrays shown below. Write a c program to compute the number of swaps performed on each value and the total number of swaps performed in the following 2 arrays:

array1: 97  16  45  63  13  22  7  58  72
array2: 90  80  70  60  50  40  30  20  10

Provide your git repository URL. 

The output should have a similar output:
array1:
7: # of times 7 is swapped
13: # of times 13 is swapped
.
.
total # of swaps

array2:
10: # of times 10 is swapped
20: # of times 20 is swapped
.
.
total # of swaps

Please pay attention that the total # swaps is not equal to the sum of the swaps of each value listed above. Can you please think about the reason of this?
